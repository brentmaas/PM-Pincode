Hello darkness, my old friend
I've come to talk with you again
Because a vision softly creeping
Left its seeds while I was sleeping
And the vision that was planted in my brain
Still remains
Within the sound of silence
9876a <=== Let erop dat de a nog met de oude code wordt gecodeerd!
In restless dreams I walked alone
Narrow streets of cobblestone
...
And touched the sound of silence
196
And the sign said, the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls
And tenement halls
