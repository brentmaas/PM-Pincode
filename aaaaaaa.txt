To be or not be, 
That's the question!

Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio?
Joltin' Joe has left9876 and gone away
Counting the cars on the New Jersey Turnpike
And the words of the prophets are written on the subway walls, tenement halls
And he carries the reminders of every 5280 glove that laid him down or cut him till he cried out "I am leaving, I am leaving", but the fighter still remains
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fishbowl, year after year
Like a bird on a wire
Like a drunk in a midnight choir
There's whiskey in the jar
The beast in me is caged by frail and fragile bars
An Eskimo showed me a movie he'd recently taken of you. The poor man could hardl
y stop shivering, his lips and his fingers were blue.
Today a new crisis has arisen
The Metropolitan Transit Authority, better known as the MTA
Is attempting to levy a burdensome tax on the population
In the form of a subway fare increase
Citizens, hear me out, this could happen to you!
It's 4 in the morning, the end of September, I'm writing you now just to see if you're better.
